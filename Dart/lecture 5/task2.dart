/*

As you may have guessed, we are trying to build up to a full tic-tac-toe board.
For now, we will simply focus on checking whether someone has WON the game, not worrying about how the moves were made.

If a game of Tic Tac Toe is represented as a list of lists, like so:

game = [[1, 2, 0],
        [2, 1, 0],
        [2, 1, 1]]
